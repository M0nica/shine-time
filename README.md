# Shine Time
The Shine Time application is your place to shine and document more granular professional (or otherwise) achievements. Did you fix a gnarly production bug in record time? Did you give your 1st (or 20th) conference talk? Did you write out some solid documentation? Make sure you capture all of this awesomeness in more in a dedicated space. These types of receipts translate well into future resumes, negotiations, annual reviews and reminders to yourself.  Inspired by Julia Evan’s article on [getting your work recognized with a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/).

## This application will support:
- User profiles and some version of public profile pages 
* Maintaining a timeline of achievements 
* Sending regular reminders for you to update us with your latest achievements 
* Privacy levels will vary between free and paid (TBD - does free have a limit to the number of achievements that can be private within a specific timeframe or are these pages by default private unless someone ways to publish them publicly?)
* Future versions may support getting professional feedback on how you’ve presented your achievements

## Potential technologies:
- NextJS
- DynamoDB or Prisma with Postgres SQL database
