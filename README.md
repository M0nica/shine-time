# Shine Time ✨
The Shine Time application is your place to shine and document more granular professional (or otherwise) achievements. Did you fix a gnarly production bug in record time? Did you give your 1st (or 20th) conference talk? Did you write out some solid documentation? Make sure you capture all of this awesomeness in more in a dedicated space. These types of receipts translate well into future resumes, negotiations, annual reviews and reminders to yourself.  Inspired by Julia Evan’s article on [getting your work recognized with a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/).

This application is intended for folks looking for more structure with how they document granular professional achievements as well as those looking to have their achievements be more visible.

## This application will support:
* Users (need login functionality)
* User profiles and some version of public profile pages.
    * ability to add basic bio information and profile picture
* Users maintaining a structured timeline of their achievements.
* Sending regular reminders for you to update us with your latest achievements 
* Dynamic Meta Images (to reflect information from someone's profile)
* Privacy levels will vary between free and paid (subscription)
    * TBD - Does the free version have a limit to the number of achievements that can be private or public within a specific timeframe? Are these pages by default private unless someone ways to publish them publicly?
    * there should be a clear way to delineate between public and private achievements

Future versions may support:
- receiving professional feedback on how you are presenting your achievements
- importing and exporting achievements

## Potential technologies:
- NextJS
- DynamoDB or Prisma with Postgres SQL database
